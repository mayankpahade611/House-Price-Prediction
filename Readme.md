#  Bangalore House Price Prediction

A **Machine Learning project** that predicts house prices in Bangalore based on key factors like **location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and balconies**.  
The project integrates **data science, machine learning, and web development** to build an end-to-end solution — from data preprocessing to a deployed **Flask web app** with an interactive UI.

---

##  Why This Project?
The real estate market in Bangalore is dynamic, and estimating property prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers.  
This project applies **regression techniques** on real housing data to provide **accurate price predictions** and demonstrates the application of ML in a real-world scenario.

---

##  Features
-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visual insights on pricing trends  
-  **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering  
-  **ML Model Training** – Regression models with evaluation metrics (R², RMSE)  
-  **Flask API + Web UI** – User-friendly interface for predictions  
-  **Model Deployment Ready** – Easy to host on cloud platforms like **Heroku / Render**
